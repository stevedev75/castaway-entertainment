# Castaway Entertainment

## My motivation for this project was to develop a full stack (MERN) application using GraphQL with Apollo Server, then deploying it via Heroku using MongoAtlas.  

#### I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of the breadth of what I learned during this 24 week web development bootcamp.  

#### This application solves the problem often of how to enter data to a database though a polished UI and then retrieve and delete that data through the polished UI.

#### In this project, I learned even more about REACT, GraphQL API, Apollo Server, authentication and Robo 3T. This process also refreshed my memory about Bootstrap and design elements.

#### Please see the screenshots below for a preview of the UI:
